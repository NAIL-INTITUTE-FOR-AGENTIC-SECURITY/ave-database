# Contributing to the AVE Database

Thank you for helping make agentic AI safer. The AVE (Agentic Vulnerabilities & Exposures) Database is the world's first structured catalogue of AI agent failure modes, modelled after the CVE system but purpose-built for autonomous agents.

**Anyone can contribute.** Security researchers, AI engineers, academics, red teamers, and practitioners who encounter unexpected agent behaviour — your field observations are exactly what makes this database valuable.

## What Belongs in the AVE Database

An AVE card documents a **repeatable failure mode, vulnerability, or emergent pathology** in AI agent systems. Good submissions include:

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Behavioural failure** | Agents deadlock in consensus loops (AVE-2025-0002) |
| **Attack vector** | Injecting false facts into shared memory (AVE-2025-0001) |
| **Resource exploitation** | Token embezzlement / EDoS attacks (AVE-2025-0003) |
| **Alignment failure** | Sycophantic collapse under pressure (AVE-2025-0012) |
| **Tool-chain exploit** | MCP tool registration poisoning (AVE-2025-0014) |
| **Emergent behaviour** | Novel pathologies not fitting existing categories |

### Key Criteria

1. **Agentic** — The vulnerability specifically affects autonomous AI agents (single or multi-agent), not traditional ML model accuracy issues.
2. **Repeatable** — Can be reproduced by others with access to similar infrastructure.
3. **Documented** — Has at minimum a clear description of the mechanism, even if a full PoC isn't available yet.

---

## What Does NOT Belong

- **Traditional ML attacks** (adversarial examples on image classifiers, model inversion)
- **General software bugs** (a framework has a Python crash — that's a GitHub Issue for that framework)
- **Prompt injection against single-turn chatbots** (unless it specifically exploits agentic capabilities like tool use, memory, or delegation)
- **Purely theoretical speculation** with no mechanism described (philosophical concerns about AGI without actionable details)

---

## How to Submit

### Option 1: GitHub Issue (Easiest)

1. Go to [**New Issue → AVE Card Submission**](https://github.com/NAIL-INSTITUTE-FOR-AGENTIC-SECURITY/ave-database/issues/new?template=ave-submission.yml)
2. Fill in the structured form
3. The NAIL team will triage, assign an AVE ID, and create the formal card

### Option 2: Pull Request (For Experienced Contributors)

1. Fork the repository
2. Generate a card skeleton:
   ```bash
   python -m ave submit --name "Your Vulnerability Name" --category memory --severity high
   ```
   This creates `ave-database/cards/AVE-DRAFT-XXXX.json` and `.md` files.
3. Fill in the generated files with your data
4. Validate:
   ```bash
   python -m ave validate ave-database/cards/AVE-DRAFT-XXXX.json
   ```
5. Submit a PR using the [pull request template](/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

### Option 3: Private Disclosure (For Severe Findings)

If your finding could be directly weaponized against production systems:

1. Use the [**Private Disclosure**](https://github.com/NAIL-INSTITUTE-FOR-AGENTIC-SECURITY/ave-database/issues/new?template=private-disclosure.yml) issue template, OR
2. Email **security@nailinstitute.org** directly

See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for our responsible disclosure policy.

## AVE Card Schema

Every AVE card has the following structure. Fields marked with `*` are required.

### Identity

| Field | Type | Description |

### Classification

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|

| `status` * | enum | `theoretical`, `proven`, `proven_mitigated`, `not_proven`, `in_progress` |

### Description

| `experiment_id` | string | Identifier for the reproduction experiment |
| `data_file` | string | Path to raw data (JSON logs, etc.) |
| `key_metric` | string | What was measured |

## Evidence Standards

We use a tiered evidence system:

| Status | Required Evidence | Example |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| `theoretical` | Mechanism description + plausible attack path | "If an agent stores user input without sanitisation..." |
| `in_progress` | Initial reproduction attempt in progress | Partial logs, preliminary results |
| `proven` | Reproducible PoC with logs/scripts | Python script + JSON log showing the failure |
| `proven_mitigated` | Proven + documented defence that reduces impact | PoC + mitigation code + before/after metrics |
| `not_proven` | Tested but could not reproduce | Negative result with methodology documented |

**Minimum for acceptance:** `theoretical` with a clear, actionable mechanism description.

**Gold standard:** A self-contained reproduction script, JSON log output, and tested defence.

---

## Review Process

1. **Triage (48h)** — NAIL team confirms the submission is in scope and assigns a reviewer
2. **Validation (1–2 weeks)** — Reviewer attempts reproduction or evaluates the mechanism
3. **Assignment** — Valid submissions receive a permanent `AVE-YYYY-NNNN` identifier
4. **Publication** — Card is merged into `ave-database/cards/` with full attribution

### What Reviewers Check

- [ ] Is this an agentic vulnerability (not a traditional software bug)?
- [ ] Is the mechanism clearly described?
- [ ] Can this be reproduced or is the theoretical path plausible?
- [ ] Does the category assignment make sense?
- [ ] Is the severity rating appropriate?
- [ ] Are there any related existing AVE cards?

---

## AVE ID Assignment

- **Draft IDs** (`AVE-DRAFT-XXXX`) — Used in PRs before review
- **Permanent IDs** (`AVE-YYYY-NNNN`) — Assigned by NAIL team after validation
  - `YYYY` = year of discovery
  - `NNNN` = sequential number within that year
- IDs are **never reused** once assigned, even if a card is later marked `not_proven`

## Severity Guidelines

| Severity | Criteria | Production Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| 🔴 **critical** | Immediate data loss, exfiltration, safety failure, or system compromise | Requires emergency response |

| 🟡 **medium** | Degrades performance or requires specific conditions | Noticeable but not catastrophic |
| 🟢 **low** | Minor impact, edge case, or mitigated by default | Negligible in most deployments |
