## 🚀 Quick Start

### Browse Vulnerabilities

Every card is available as **JSON** (machine-readable) and **Markdown** (human-readable):

```
ave-database/
├── cards/
│   ├── AVE-2025-0001.json    ← Machine-readable card
│   ├── AVE-2025-0001.md      ← Human-readable companion
│   └── ...
├── index.json                ← Full database index
├── severity_index.json       ← Cards grouped by severity
└── README.md                 ← You are here
```

### Query via CLI

```bash
pip install -e ave/            # Install the AVE toolkit
python -m ave list             # List all cards
python -m ave show AVE-2025-0001   # Detailed view
python -m ave search -k "injection"  # Search by keyword
python -m ave stats            # Database statistics
python -m ave validate ave-database/cards/  # Validate all cards
python -m ave submit --interactive  # Generate a draft card

## ⚠️ Access Tiers

The AVE Database operates on a **two-tier access model**:

| Tier | What You Get | Access |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 🔓 **PUBLIC** | Name, summary, blast radius, prerequisites, severity, category, AVSS score | **Free** — this repo (CC-BY-SA-4.0) |
| 🔒 **FULL** | + Mechanism details, evidence, PoC scripts, defence implementations, AVSS vectors | [NAIL SDK](https://github.com/{PUBLIC_ORG}) |

Public cards give you enough to **understand and identify the threat**.
Full cards give you enough to **reproduce, test, and defend against it**.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

**Anyone can submit vulnerabilities.** We welcome security researchers, AI engineers,
academics, red teamers, and practitioners.

### Three Ways to Submit

| Method | Difficulty | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| [**GitHub Issue**](https://github.com/{PUBLIC_SLUG}/issues/new?template=ave-submission.yml) | Easy | First-time contributors — fill in a structured form |
| [**Pull Request**](./CONTRIBUTING.md#option-2-pull-request-for-experienced-contributors) | Moderate | Experienced contributors — submit JSON + Markdown directly |
| [**Private Disclosure**](./SECURITY.md) | Any | Severe/weaponizable findings — responsible disclosure process |

### Generate a Card Skeleton

```bash
python -m ave submit --name "My Vulnerability" --category memory --severity high
python -m ave submit --interactive
python -m ave validate ave-database/cards/AVE-DRAFT-0001.json
```
